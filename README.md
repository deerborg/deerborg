I am a software developer with strong experience in backend and frontend technologies. I have solid skills in Java and Spring framework for backend development, and I am also experienced in building modern, responsive web applications using React. Additionally, I have worked with Kotlin for building scalable and efficient applications.

I am familiar with containerization and deployment using Docker, which helps me deliver reliable and maintainable software solutions. I enjoy solving complex problems and developing applications that provide great user experience.

Besides coding, I have experience with Adobe Creative Cloud tools such as Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Adobe XD, and After Effects, which allow me to create and enhance visual content to complement the applications I build.
